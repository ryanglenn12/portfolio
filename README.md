This is Ryan Glenn's coding portfolio. On here you will find scripts related to his thesis on charactering aerosol and gas emissions from the Palisades and Eaton wildfires using whole air sampling data and a MATLAB-based atmospheric box model called F0AM, as well as Google Earth Engine scripts that anaylyze TEMPO and LANDSAT satellite imagery.
