This is Ryan Glenn's coding portfolio. On here you will find MATLAB-based scripts for the F0AM model (where he is modeling Palisades wildfire
gas chemistry over time), Google Earth Engine scripts that calculate spectral indices like NDVI of satellite images, and some labs created in
his introductory programming class in Python.
